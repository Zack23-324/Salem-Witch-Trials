The trials were triggered by claims of witchcraft and possession by teenage girls in the community. These claims led to a widespread panic, resulting in dozens of arrests and imprisonments. The trials were characterized by a lack of due process, false accusations, and mass hysteria, and resulted in the execution of 25 individuals. The trials officially came to an end in May 1693, when the governor of Massachusetts ordered a halt to the proceedings and released all those who were still imprisoned.";

These include the teenage girls who first claimed to have been possessed by witches - Betty Parris, Abigail Williams, and Ann Putnam Jr. Whose accusations sparked the trials. Another significant figure was Cotton Mather, a Puritan minister and writer who supported the trials and believed in the reality of witchcraft. The most well-known figure, however, was  Judge Samuel Sewall, who presided over many of the trials and later publicly apologized for his role in the events. Other notable individuals include the accused and the executed, many of whom were women, and who have since become symbols of the injustice and tragedy of the trials.";
